# Introduction to rqualify

The primary goal of rqualify is to ease the R software validation steps
required for regulatory submissions. The `rqualify` function automates
the generation of a validation document that can be used to demonstrate
that an R environment is suitable for use in a regulated setting.

Once the `rqualify` package is installed, executing the validation
script is as simple as running the function:

``` r

library(rqualify)
rqualify(path_save = tempdir())
```

Ensure the folder you specify does not already include a folder named
`R-validation`. See
[`?rqualify`](https://medtronic-biostatistics.github.io/rqualify/reference/rqualify.md)
for more info.

## How does rqualify work?

The `rqualify` function performs the following steps:

1.  Creates the folder tree `R-validation/IQ-OQ-TestOutput` at the
    specified `path_save`.
2.  Installs TinyTeX and necessary LaTeX packages (if
    `setup_tinytex=TRUE`).
3.  Installs Pandoc (if `setup_pandoc=TRUE`).
4.  Copies `R-validation.Rmd` to the `R-validation` folder.
5.  Executes the IQ-OQ by rendering `R-validation.Rmd` to
    `R-validation.tex`.
6.  Compiles `R-validation.tex` to `R-validation.pdf`.

In case you are developing a process for user-level qualification, the
file `R-validation.Rmd` located in the root directory of this package at
`qualify_r/R-validation.Rmd` can be used as a template for your own
validation document. Note, if viewing on Github, the `R-validation.Rmd`
file is located at `inst/qualify_r/R-validation.Rmd`.

Alternately, you can execute the validation proces via Quarto and Typst.
In that instance, the following steps are performed:

1.  Creates the folder tree `R-validation/IQ-OQ-TestOutput` at the
    specified `path_save`.
2.  Copies `R-validation.Qmd` to the `R-validation` folder.
3.  Executes the IQ-OQ by rendering `R-validation.Qmd` via Quarto and
    Typst to `R-validation.pdf`.

## Tips for a Successful Qualification

- Best practice is to Install and execute the qualification code on a
  new and fresh installation of R, prior to installing additional
  packages.
- Install and validate on a new minor release of R, e.g., upgrading from
  4.**4**.3 to 4.**5**.1; notice the bold numbers indicate the minor
  releases.
- If unwilling to install and validate on a new minor release of R,
  e.g., upgrading from 4.**4**.1 to 4.**4**.2, the validation may
  **fail**.
- If running the validation a second time within the same `R-validation`
  folder, remove or rename the `IQ-OQ-TestOutput` subfolder that was
  created.
