# Run IQ-OQ on an installation of R software

Run IQ-OQ on an installation of R software

## Usage

``` r
rqualify(
  path_save,
  setup_tinytex = TRUE,
  setup_pandoc = TRUE,
  render_latex = TRUE,
  engine = "latex",
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- path_save:

  Character. Path to save the R-validation folder. Ensure a folder named
  R-validation does not already exist at this location.

- setup_tinytex:

  Logical. If TRUE, sets up TinyTeX for LaTeX document generation. Note,
  this does not install the tinytex R package, but the TinyTeX LaTeX
  bundle. It is a convenient wrapper for installing TinyTeX using
  [`tinytex::install_tinytex()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/tinytex/man/install_tinytex.html),
  and adding the TinyTeX location to the environment. The function
  installs the "TinyTeX" bundle and the additional package grfext, and
  sets the TinyTeX installation path on the system PATH.

- setup_pandoc:

  Logical. If TRUE, sets up pandoc for document conversion. Note, this
  does not install the pandoc R package, but the Pandoc software. It is
  a convenient wrapper around
  [`pandoc::pandoc_install()`](https://cderv.github.io/pandoc/reference/pandoc_install.html)
  and \`
  [`pandoc::pandoc_activate()`](https://cderv.github.io/pandoc/reference/pandoc_activate.html),
  which are called internally.

- render_latex:

  Logical. If TRUE, renders the generated LaTeX file to PDF using
  [`tinytex::pdflatex()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/tinytex/man/latexmk.html)
  when engine is set to "latex". If FALSE, the LaTeX file will be
  generated but not rendered to PDF.

- engine:

  Character. Engine to generate the PDF. Either `latex` or `quarto`

- verbose:

  Logical. If TRUE, prints progress messages to the console.

## Value

The path to the R-validation folder. The primary purpose of this
function is its side effects, rendering an RMarkdown document.

## Details

This function creates a folder named R-validation at the specified path,
and generates a PDF report. Depending on the `engine` argument, the
report can be generated with LaTeX or with typst (via Quarto). If
`engine = "latex"`, it allows users to conveniently install TinyTeX and
Pandox, render an RMarkdown file to LaTeX, compiles the LaTeX to PDF,
and saves the output in the created folder. If `engine = "quarto"`, it
instead uses Quarto to render the report via typst. Quarto, pandoc, and
typst are all part of the standard RStudio installation, therefore
requiring no additional software installation.

The validation process involves running a series of tests on the R
installation and can be quite time consuming. The function will print
progress messages to the console if `verbose` is set to TRUE.

The following steps are carried out using default arguments:

1.  Create the folder tree R-validation/IQ-OQ-TestOutput at `path_save`

2.  Install TinyTeX and necessary LaTeX packages

3.  Install Pandoc

4.  Copy RMarkdown validation file to the R-validation folder

5.  Execute the IQ-OQ by rendering the RMarkdown file to LaTeX

6.  Compile the LaTeX file to pdf

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # tinytex::is_tinytex() && pandoc::pandoc_available()
# \donttest{
# Render the R-validation report, must have TinyTeX and Pandoc installed for 
# this example, otherwise set setup_tinytex and setup_pandoc to TRUE.
rqualify(path_save     = tempdir(),
         setup_tinytex = FALSE,
         setup_pandoc  = FALSE)
# }
DONTSHOW({
unlink(file.path(tempdir(), "R-validation"), recursive=TRUE)
})
  
}
```
